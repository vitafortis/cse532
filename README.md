ChatGPT assisted throughout the project by helping design the system architecture, implementing and refining the Flask API endpoints, guiding database modeling and migrations, resolving backend and frontend errors, and developing the interactive analytics dashboard using Chart.js, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It also provided solutions for caching, OSV integration, SQLAlchemy issues, schema drift, and frontend data rendering, while offering clear explanations, debugging support, and documentation. All contributions focused on enabling a stable, fully functional vulnerability-analytics platform with real-time and historical views.
